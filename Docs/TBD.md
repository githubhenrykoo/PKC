## 1. Executive Summary

The PKC (Personal Knowledge Container) platform represents a revolutionary approach to IoT workflow management, data integration, and AI-assisted automation. This document outlines the development plan for transforming PKC from a basic dashboard system into a comprehensive, MCP-based ecosystem that enables seamless interaction between humans, AI agents, and IoT devices.

### Key Objectives
- Enable LLM-controlled IoT device management through natural language
- Implement comprehensive data integration with MCard storage system
- Establish temporal awareness for context-driven AI assistance
- Transform architecture to MCP-based extensible ecosystem
