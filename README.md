> **A revolutionary interactive knowledge management platform** that enables interactive testing, systematic knowledge accumulation, and collaborative function development through mathematically rigorous polynomial functor structures.

## 🌟 What is PKC?

**PKC (Progressive Knowledge Container)** transforms how we develop, test, and understand software functions by creating an **interactive testing environment** where code becomes a living repository of knowledge. Unlike traditional development approaches, PKC enables **Conversational Programming** - an ongoing dialogue with your code that builds comprehensive understanding through incremental exploration.

### Core Innovation: Conversational Programming

PKC revolutionizes software development by treating function testing as an **interactive conversation**:

- **Interactive Exploration**: Continuously probe functions with new test cases and input combinations
- **Knowledge Accumulation**: Each test case and execution becomes part of a growing knowledge base
- **Collaborative Intelligence**: Multiple developers contribute insights to the same function's understanding
- **Mathematical Rigor**: Polynomial functor structures ensure formal correctness and compositionality
- **Pattern Recognition**: Automatic discovery of optimization opportunities and edge cases

## 🏗️ Triadic Architecture

PKC implements a sophisticated **triadic architecture** where every component works together to enable conversational programming:

### 🗃️ MCard: Universal Atomic Storage
**The Data Plane** - Immutable, content-addressable storage for all knowledge artifacts:
- Test cases, execution records, and insights stored as atomic MCards
- IPFS-compatible hashing ensures universal content identification
- Local-first embedded database with distributed synchronization
- Complete execution history preserved for knowledge continuity

### 🧠 PCard: Conversational Programming Engine  
**The Control Plane** - Interactive testing environment powered by polynomial functors:
- **Interactive Testing Manager**: Create and execute test cases through conversation
- **Knowledge Accumulation System**: Systematic collection of testing insights
- **Pattern Recognition Engine**: Automatic optimization and edge case discovery
- **Collaborative Intelligence**: Multi-user contributions to function knowledge
- **Polynomial Structure**: Mathematical rigor through functor algebra
- **Universal Execution Layer**: REPL-like wrapper supporting diverse execution providers including:
  - Traditional functions
  - LLM inference engines
  - MCP tool providers
  - External APIs and distributed computing resources

#### Flux-to-Flow (Control Plane Coordination)
- See the Flux-to-Flow design: [Docs/flux2flow_state-management.md](./Docs/flux2flow_state-management.md)
- PocketFlow bus (`src/pocketflow/bus.ts`) and topics (`src/pocketflow/events.ts`) coordinate UI/data flows
- Panels/places align with `src/layouts/AppShell.astro` and `src/layouts/MainLayout.astro`
- Event-first, hash-first payloads; reducers subscribe to events; selectors remain for derived views

### 🔐 VCard: Security & Collaboration Layer
**The Application Plane** - Secure boundaries for collaborative knowledge sharing:
- Distributed authentication with JWT and hash-based signatures
- Formal security boundaries for multi-user collaboration
- Value exchange mechanisms for knowledge contributions
- Network security integration with libP2P protocols

- One-step deployment using Docker Compose
 - Environment variables loaded from `.env` (client uses only `PUBLIC_*` at runtime)

```
# 1) Create your environment file from the example
cp exmaple.env .env

# 2) Start the stack
docker compose up -d

# 3) Check logs (optional)
docker compose logs -f

# 4) Stop the stack
docker compose down
